# python-Portuguese-SATOR-square
This repository provides Python code that searches for SATOR squares in Portuguese.
Specifically in Portuguese because this language has one of the worst structures for this kind of symmetry. Unlike Latin or English, there are fewer palindromes, "squarable" words, more obligatory terminations, words have grammatical gender. Overall, this task is a true linguistics + programming challenge.
